Without the `stats` shape we’d either drop that summary or recompute counts on the client for every render. Returning the stats from the API keeps that block working, avoids duplicating the aggregation logic in the UI, and stays consistent with how the existing `/api/teams?include=stats` endpoint behaves."}]}}
