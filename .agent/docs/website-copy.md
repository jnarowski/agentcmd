# agentcmd - Value Proposition Outline

## The Problem
Developers are tired of **babysitting their AI coding agents**. Manually running slash commands, waiting for agents to finish, then running the next command. Can't leave your computer. Can't automate your full workflow. Every team has different processes but tools force you into rigid frameworks.

## The Solution
**Orchestrate AI coding agents to match YOUR exact workflow.** Build custom automations that chain together slash commands, run in parallel, and execute your team's specific SDLC - however you define it.

## Core Value Propositions

### 1. Stop Babysitting AI Agents
**Pain point addressed:**
- Manual execution of multi-step workflows
- Sitting at computer waiting for agents to finish
- Repetitive: spec → implement → review → fix (over and over)

**Value:**
- Automate entire SDLC cycles
- Walk away while workflows run
- No more manual intervention

### 2. Your Workflows, Your Way (PRIMARY DIFFERENTIATOR)
**Pain point addressed:**
- Every engineering team has different processes
- Existing tools force rigid methodologies
- Can't adapt tools to your specific needs

**Value:**
- Build exactly what YOUR team needs
- Create custom slash commands for YOUR process
- No forced frameworks or methodologies
- Every team is different - own it

### 3. Orchestrate Multiple Agents & Tools
**Pain point addressed:**
- Limited to one agent at a time
- Can't combine different AI tools
- Manual context switching between tools

**Value:**
- Chain commands together (your custom ones + built-in)
- Run workflows in parallel with git worktrees
- Mix Claude Code, Codex, direct LLM calls, CLI commands
- Get multiple AI perspectives on same code

### 4. Code from Anywhere
**Pain point addressed:**
- Tied to your computer
- Can't check status or trigger workflows remotely
- No mobile access

**Value:**
- Mobile-friendly web interface
- Runs on your local machine (performance + privacy)
- Access via Tailscale from anywhere
- Start workflows from your phone

### 5. Free & Open Source
**Pain point addressed:**
- Cloud costs for hosted solutions
- Vendor lock-in
- Can't extend or customize closed tools

**Value:**
- Run locally, zero cloud costs
- Fork and extend the codebase
- No vendor lock-in
- Huge performance gains (local execution)

## Key Capabilities (What You Can Build)

### Workflow Building Blocks
- **step.agent** - Call Claude Code, Codex (agentic CLIs)
- **step.ai** - Direct LLM calls (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- **step.cli** - Run any CLI command
- **step.artifact** - Attach screenshots/images (e2e tests)
- **step.annotate** - Add human-readable messages

### Real-World Use Cases
1. **Full SDLC automation** - Spec → Implement → Review → Fix (unattended)
2. **Custom deployments** - YOUR test suite, YOUR standards, YOUR process
3. **Parallel testing** - Test multiple branches simultaneously with worktrees
4. **Visual regression** - E2E tests + AI screenshot analysis + auto-fix
5. **Multi-perspective reviews** - Different AIs focus on architecture/bugs/readability

---

## Target Audience

### Primary
**Individual developers** frustrated with:
- Babysitting AI agents through multi-step workflows
- Being tied to their computer
- Manual, repetitive AI orchestration

### Secondary
**Dev leaders** who want:
- Team-wide workflow automation
- Custom processes that match their engineering culture
- Ability to standardize without being rigid

## Positioning & Messaging

### Main Tagline
**"Stop Babysitting Your AI Coding Agents"**

### Supporting Tagline
**"Build workflows that match YOUR SDLC. Your slash commands. Your processes."**

### Key Message Themes

**Customization Over Convention**
- "Your workflows, your way"
- "Not the other way around"
- "Every team is different"
- "Build exactly what you need"

**Frustration → Empowerment**
- "Stop babysitting" → "Automate everything"
- "Tied to computer" → "Code from anywhere"
- "Rigid frameworks" → "Fully customizable"

**Honest & Transparent**
- Only supports Claude Code + Codex (for now)
- Free and open source
- No fake testimonials or inflated claims
- Built by developers who felt the pain

---

## Competitive Differentiators

1. **Customization-first** - Not "use our workflow," but "build your workflow"
2. **Local execution** - Performance + privacy (vs cloud-only solutions)
3. **Multi-agent orchestration** - Combine different AI tools (vs single-agent tools)
4. **Mobile access** - Run workflows from phone (vs desktop-only)
5. **Free & open source** - No costs, no lock-in (vs SaaS pricing)

---

## Call to Action Options

**Primary CTA:** "Build Workflows That Match Your Process"
**Supporting:** "Not the other way around."

**Button text options:**
- "Get Started"
- "View on GitHub"
- "Download Now"
- "See the Docs"
