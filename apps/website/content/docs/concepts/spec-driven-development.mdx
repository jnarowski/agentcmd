Spec-driven development is a methodology where you define **what to build** in structured documents before building it. Specs serve as the requirements layer that guides implementation—whether done by humans, AI agents, or both.

## Why Specs?

Without specs, development happens through ad-hoc conversations with no memory or traceability. Whether working with AI agents or human teams, specs provide:

- **Structured requirements** - Clear, consistent, parseable specifications
- **Lifecycle tracking** - Status progression from planning → implementation → review → completion
- **Version control** - Specs live alongside code in your repository, not in external tools
- **Repeatability** - Same implementation process for every feature using your project's conventions
- **Audit trail** - Complexity estimates, task tracking, timestamps, and change history
- **Shared understanding** - Single source of truth for what needs to be built

## The Automation Pipeline

Specs enable a complete development workflow:

1. **Generate** - Create spec from requirements (AI-assisted or manual)
2. **Plan** - Break down into tasks with complexity estimates
3. **Implement** - Build according to structured requirements
4. **Track** - Mark progress inline (e.g., markdown checkboxes)
5. **Review** - Validate implementation against spec
6. **Ship** - Mark complete, merge changes

This workflow can be fully automated with AI agents, partially automated with human oversight, or entirely manual—specs provide the structure for all approaches.

## Anatomy of a Spec

While format varies by tool, most specs include:

**Metadata:**

- Status (planning, in-progress, done)
- Creation date and author
- Complexity estimate
- Dependencies

**Content:**

- Overview/purpose
- Requirements/acceptance criteria
- Task breakdown
- Implementation notes
- Test plan

**Example structure:**

```markdown
# Feature: User Authentication

**Status**: in-progress
**Created**: 2025-01-15
**Complexity**: 35 points

## Overview

JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens...

## Requirements

- Users can sign in with email/password
- Sessions expire after 24 hours
- Tokens refresh automatically

## Tasks

- [ ] Create auth service
- [ ] Add login endpoint
- [ ] Implement token validation
```

## Spec-Driven Development with AI

Specs are particularly powerful when combined with AI agents:

- **AI-generated specs** - Agents can create detailed specs from high-level requirements
- **Automated implementation** - Agents implement features by following spec requirements
- **Continuous validation** - Agents verify implementation matches spec
- **Self-correction** - Failed validation triggers fixes until spec is satisfied

This creates a feedback loop where specs guide AI behavior and AI enforces spec compliance.

## Using Specs in <AgentCmd />

<AgentCmd /> implements spec-driven development through its [Spec Task System](/docs/concepts/spec-task-system):

- Markdown-based specs in `.agent/specs/`
- Lifecycle management (backlog → todo → doing → done)
- AI-powered generation and implementation
- Built-in complexity scoring
- Workflow automation integration

See the [Spec Task System](/docs/concepts/spec-task-system) documentation for implementation details.

## Best Practices

### Write Specs First

Define requirements before coding:

```
✅ Spec → Implement → Review
❌ Code → Retrofit spec
```

### Keep Specs Focused

Break complex features into manageable specs:

```
❌ Single mega-spec: "Complete user management system"
✅ Multiple focused specs:
  - User authentication
  - User profiles
  - Role-based permissions
```

### Update Specs During Implementation

Specs are living documents:

- Mark tasks complete as you go
- Update requirements if scope changes
- Document decisions and trade-offs

### Version Control

Treat specs like code:

- Commit specs alongside code
- Review spec changes in PRs
- Track evolution over time
