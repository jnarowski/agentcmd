Agents are AI CLI tools (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Google Gemini) that agentcmd orchestrates to automate development tasks.

## What is an Agent?

Think of agents as AI teammates that can:

- Read and write files in your codebase
- Execute shell commands
- Analyze code and make decisions
- Have multi-turn conversations
- Complete complex tasks end-to-end

Unlike chatbots, agents take **action** - they don't just suggest, they implement.

## How You Control Agents

You orchestrate agents with **slash commands** - pre-built instructions that tell agents what to do.

### Example: `/cmd:generate-feature-spec`

When you run:

```bash
/cmd:generate-feature-spec "Add dark mode support"
```

agentcmd orchestrates Claude to:

1. Analyze your codebase for existing patterns
2. Research similar implementations
3. Generate comprehensive feature spec
4. Create spec folder in `.agent/specs/todo/`
5. Update spec index
6. Return spec ID for implementation

**You issued one command. The agent did the work.**

### Custom Orchestration

Create `.claude/commands/analyze-pr.md`:

```markdown
Analyze pull request for security issues.

Arguments:

- pr_number: PR to analyze

Steps:

1. Fetch PR via gh CLI
2. Analyze code changes
3. Report findings
```

Now `/analyze-pr 123` orchestrates the agent with your custom instructions.

## Agent Types

agentcmd supports 3 agents:

| Agent            | Best For               | Strengths                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Claude Code**  | Planning, architecture | Reasoning, safety, large context  |
| **OpenAI Codex** | Code generation        | Fast, excellent at implementation |
| **Google Gemini** | Multimodal tasks       | Images, cost-effective            |

Choose based on task requirements:

- Complex analysis → Claude
- Pure coding → Codex
- Image analysis → Gemini

## Programmatic Orchestration

Workflows use `step.agent()` to orchestrate agents programmatically:

```typescript
await step.agent("implement-feature", {
  agent: "claude",
  prompt: buildSlashCommand("/cmd:implement-spec", {
    specId: "251113152201",
  }),
});
```

This is the same as running `/cmd:implement-spec 251113152201` in CLI, but from code.

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

Combine agents for optimal results:

```typescript
// Claude plans (best at reasoning)
const plan = await step.agent("plan", {
  agent: "claude",
  prompt: "Design authentication system",
  permissionMode: "plan", // Read-only
});

// Codex implements (best at coding)
await step.agent("code", {
  agent: "codex",
  prompt: "Implement the auth design",
  resume: plan.sessionId, // Continue conversation
});
```

Agents share **sessions** - conversation history stored on disk. Resuming lets the second agent see everything the first agent learned.

## Agent Sessions

When agents work, they create sessions (conversation history):

- Stored on disk (`~/.claude/projects/...`)
- Resume across steps
- Share context between agents
- Can be used to generate specs later
