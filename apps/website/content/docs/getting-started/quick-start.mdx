Get from zero to your first AI workflow in 5 minutes.

## Start the Server

Launch both the backend and frontend:

```bash
npx agentcmd start
```

This starts three services:

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Frontend** | 5173 | Web UI for managing projects and workflows |
| **Backend** | 3456 | API server and WebSocket |
| **Inngest UI** | 8288 | Workflow execution dashboard |

**Output**:
```text title="Server Output"
✓ Backend running on http://localhost:3456
✓ Frontend running on http://localhost:5173
✓ Inngest Dev UI on http://localhost:8288

<AgentCMD /> is ready! Open http://localhost:5173
```

<Callout type="tip">
**Keep this terminal open** - It shows live logs from workflow executions. Open a new tab for other commands.
</Callout>

## Open the UI

Navigate to the web interface:

```bash
open http://localhost:5173
```

You'll see the **<AgentCMD /> Dashboard** with:
- **Projects** (empty for now)
- **Workflows** library
- **Sessions** history

## Create Your First Project

A project connects <AgentCMD /> to your codebase.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Click "New Project"

    In the top right of the dashboard
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Enter Project Details

    - **Name**: "My First Project"
    - **Path**: `/path/to/your/codebase`

    <Callout type="info">
    Use an existing codebase you want to automate, or create a test directory with `mkdir ~/agentcmd-test && cd ~/agentcmd-test && git init`
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Click "Create Project"

    <AgentCMD /> scans the directory and creates the project
  </Step>
</Steps>

You should see your project in the dashboard:

```text title="Project Display"
My First Project
/path/to/your/codebase
0 workflows run | 0 sessions
```

## Run an Example Workflow

<AgentCMD /> includes example workflows to test your setup.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Click into your project

    Select "My First Project" from the dashboard
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Navigate to Workflows tab

    See the built-in example workflows:
    - **Example Basic Workflow** - CLI commands, git, artifacts
    - **Example Implement Review** - Multi-phase with AI agents
    - **Example Kitchen Sink** - All 8 step types
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Click "Run" on Example Basic Workflow

    This workflow doesn't require AI agents - perfect for testing!
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Watch Live Execution

    The timeline shows:
    - ✓ Phase: Setup
    - ✓ Phase: Build
    - ✓ Phase: Test
    - ✓ Phase: Deploy

    Each step streams output in real-time via WebSocket
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Timeline view** shows:
- Step status (pending/running/completed/failed)
- Live output from CLI commands
- Annotations marking progress
- Artifacts generated

## View Inngest Dashboard

See workflow execution under the hood:

```bash
open http://localhost:8288
```

The **Inngest Dev UI** shows:
- Function runs (your workflows)
- Step-by-step execution
- Retry logic and errors
- Event history

This is helpful for debugging failed workflows.

## Explore the UI

### Projects Tab
- **Overview** - Stats, recent workflows
- **Workflows** - Available workflows to run
- **Sessions** - AI agent conversation history
- **Settings** - Project configuration

### Workflow Run Page
- **Timeline** - Visual step-by-step progress
- **Logs** - Full output from each step
- **Artifacts** - Files/images generated
- **Events** - WebSocket event stream

### Sessions Tab
- **Session List** - All AI conversations
- **Resume** - Continue previous sessions in new workflows
- **Messages** - Full conversation history
