Unlike desktop-only AI coding tools, <AgentCmd /> runs in your browser - making it the **only AI workflow orchestrator you can access from your phone, tablet, or any device**.

## Why It Matters

**Start workflows on your laptop. Monitor on your phone. Review on your tablet.**

- Long-running refactors? Check progress from your phone while getting coffee
- Multi-hour test suites? Monitor from the couch
- Client demo? Pull up live workflow execution on any device
- Late-night deployment? Watch from bed without opening your laptop

## Mobile-First Design

Built responsive from day one:

- ✓ Real-time workflow timeline on mobile
- ✓ Stream logs and outputs
- ✓ Browse sessions and artifacts
- ✓ Touch-optimized controls
- ✓ Full feature parity with desktop

The entire UI adapts to your screen - no separate mobile app needed.

## Remote Access with Tailscale

Access your local <AgentCmd /> server from anywhere with [Tailscale's](https://tailscale.com) zero-config VPN:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install Tailscale

    On your development machine:

    ```bash
    # macOS
    brew install tailscale

    # Linux
    curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
    ```

    Download the [Tailscale app](https://tailscale.com/download) for your phone/tablet (100% free for personal use).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Connect to your Tailnet

    ```bash
    tailscale up
    ```

    Follow the prompt to authenticate.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure WebSocket host

    Set the WebSocket host environment variable before starting <AgentCmd />:

    ```bash
    export VITE_WS_HOST=your-machine-name.tail-scale-name.ts.net:3456
    npx agentcmd start
    ```

    This ensures WebSocket connections work when accessing remotely.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Access from any device

    On your phone/tablet (with Tailscale app connected):

    ```
    http://your-machine-name.tail-scale-name.ts.net:3456
    ```

    Your machine name appears in the Tailscale admin console.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
**2-minute setup, lifetime access.** Once configured, your <AgentCmd /> server is accessible on any device connected to your Tailnet - phone, tablet, or another laptop.
</Callout>

## Alternative Remote Access Options

### VPN

Connect to your home/office network via VPN and access:

```
http://localhost:3456
```

Works with any VPN: WireGuard, OpenVPN, corporate VPN, etc.

### Cloud Deployment

Run <AgentCmd /> on a Mac Mini, home server, or always-on desktop for persistent access. Or deploy to a VPS for always-on remote access:

```bash
pm2 start "npx agentcmd start" --name agentcmd
```

See [Deployment](/docs/deployment) for production setup with HTTPS and authentication.

### SSH Tunnel

Quick one-off access via SSH port forwarding:

```bash
ssh -L 3456:localhost:3456 your-dev-machine
```

Then access `http://localhost:3456` on your local machine.

## Security Considerations

When enabling remote access:

- **Tailscale** encrypts all traffic automatically
- **VPN** provides network-level security
- **Cloud deployments** should use HTTPS and authentication
- **SSH tunnels** are encrypted by default

For production use, consider adding authentication middleware to the <AgentCmd /> server.
