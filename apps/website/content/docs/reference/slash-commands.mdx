<AgentCmd /> includes powerful slash commands for common workflow automation tasks.

## Overview

Slash commands are pre-built workflows accessible via CLI or custom commands.

## Available Commands

### `/generate-feature-spec`

Generate feature implementation spec with tasks and complexity estimates.

**Usage**:
```bash
/generate-feature-spec [context]
```

**Arguments**:
- `context` - Feature description or requirements (optional if continuing conversation)

**What it does**:
1. Analyzes feature requirements
2. Breaks down into tasks
3. Estimates complexity per task
4. Writes spec to `.agent/specs/todo/`
5. Updates spec index

**Example**:
```bash
/generate-feature-spec "Add dark mode toggle to settings"
```

---

### `/implement-spec`

Implement feature from spec file.

**Usage**:
```bash
/implement-spec <spec-id-or-name-or-path>
```

**Arguments**:
- `spec-id-or-name-or-path` - Spec ID, feature name, or full path

**What it does**:
1. Reads spec file
2. Updates status to "in-progress"
3. Implements each task in order
4. Checks off tasks as completed
5. Updates status to "review"

**Example**:
```bash
/implement-spec 251116105638
/implement-spec dark-mode
/implement-spec .agent/specs/todo/251116105638-dark-mode/spec.md
```

---

### `/review-spec-implementation`

Review implementation against spec.

**Usage**:
```bash
/review-spec-implementation <spec-id-or-name-or-path>
```

**What it does**:
1. Reads spec and implementation
2. Verifies all tasks completed
3. Checks for deviations
4. Runs validation (tests, build)
5. Documents findings

**Example**:
```bash
/review-spec-implementation 251116105638
```

---

### `/commit-and-push`

Create commit, push, and optionally create PR.

**Usage**:
```bash
/commit-and-push [base-branch]
```

**What it does**:
1. Runs git status and diff
2. Analyzes changes
3. Creates descriptive commit message
4. Commits changes
5. Pushes to remote
6. Creates PR if on feature branch

**Example**:
```bash
/commit-and-push main
```

---

### `/pull-request`

Create pull request with detailed description.

**Usage**:
```bash
/pull-request [title]
```

**What it does**:
1. Analyzes branch changes
2. Generates PR title and description
3. Creates test plan
4. Creates PR via GitHub CLI

**Example**:
```bash
/pull-request "Add dark mode feature"
```

{/* END AUTO-GENERATED:slash-commands-end */}

## Creating Custom Commands

Create your own slash commands in `.claude/commands/`:

```bash
# Create command file
echo "Generate comprehensive test suite for the current file" > .claude/commands/gen-tests.md

# Use it
/gen-tests
```

**See**: [Custom Slash Commands](/examples/custom-slash-command) for full tutorial.

## Command Best Practices

### Chaining Commands

Combine commands for complete workflows:

```bash
# Generate spec → implement → review → commit
/generate-feature-spec "Add user authentication"
/implement-spec user-authentication
/review-spec-implementation user-authentication
/commit-and-push main
```

### Iterative Development

Use commands iteratively:

```bash
# Start implementation
/implement-spec my-feature

# Review progress
/review-spec-implementation my-feature

# Continue if issues found
/implement-spec my-feature

# Final review
/review-spec-implementation my-feature
```

### CI/CD Integration

Use commands in CI pipelines:

```bash
# In CI script
/review-spec-implementation $SPEC_ID
/pull-request "Automated implementation of $FEATURE"
```
